# New Class Code Playbook 🎉

## 1. Welcome to the Orthodox Canonical Form Club! 🎓
From now on, all your classes must join the exclusive ranks of the Orthodox Canonical Form, unless you receive special clearance otherwise.

## 2. The Fantastic Four! 👑
To join the club, each class must feature these four superstar members:
- **Default constructor** (The magic opener 🪄)
- **Copy constructor** (The clone master 🧬)
- **Copy assignment operator** (The switcheroo artist 🔄)
- **Destructor** (The clean-up crew 🧹)

## 3. Divide and Conquer! ⚔️
- **Header file (.hpp/.h):** Contains the class's royal decree (definition).
- **Source file (.cpp):** Implements the class's grand plan (implementation).

# You Think You Know Numbers? Think Again! 😏

## Step 1: The Basics 🤔
Up until now, you've been working with:
- **Integers** and their buddies (short, char, long, etc.)
- **Floating-point numbers** and their cousins (float, double, etc.)

These have been your go-to number types in coding.

## Step 2: Opposite Characteristics ⚖️
Integers and floating-point numbers couldn't be more different in their characteristics. It’s a classic case of opposites attract.

## Step 3: Meet the Game Changer 🚀
Introducing **fixed-point numbers**—your new best friend in coding! Fixed-point numbers strike the perfect balance between:
- **Performance** 💨
- **Accuracy** 🎯
- **Range** 📏
- **Precision** 🔬

## Why Should You Care? 🤷‍♂️
Fixed-point numbers are particularly useful in:
- **Computer graphics** 🎨: For flawless visual calculations.
- **Sound processing** 🎵: Keeping your audio crisp and clear.
- **Scientific programming** 🔬: Ensuring your data remains spot on.

Fixed-point numbers are here to elevate your coding game. Embrace the change and enjoy the ride! 🎉
