# New Class Code Playbook 🎉

## 1. Welcome to the Orthodox Canonical Form Club! 🎓
From now on, all your classes must join the exclusive ranks of the Orthodox Canonical Form, unless you receive special clearance otherwise.

## 2. The Fantastic Four! 👑
To join the club, each class must feature these four superstar members:
- **Default constructor** (The magic opener 🪄)
- **Copy constructor** (The clone master 🧬)
- **Copy assignment operator** (The switcheroo artist 🔄)
- **Destructor** (The clean-up crew 🧹)

## 3. Divide and Conquer! ⚔️
- **Header file (.hpp/.h):** Contains the class's royal decree (definition).
- **Source file (.cpp):** Implements the class's grand plan (implementation).

Go forth and code with style! 🚀
